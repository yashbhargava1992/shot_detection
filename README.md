# shot_detection

Using a binned light curve the goal is to detect shots in the light curve. The shots are defined as fast rising and falling flares are observed to happen in a time scales of few seconds. The count rates seem to jump by a factor of 1.5-2 in the interval. 

The shots which are physical (i.e. from the source) will be visible in all the instruments and in all energy ranges. Thus it is quite easy to discern from the fake (i.e. those arising from poissonian fluctuations). 

Given the bright nature of the source (Cyg X-1 in this case) we can find shots in soft energy in a single LAXPC unit and fit the the found shots in other energy bands and units.
